# JapaneseTypingHelper
## The ultimate way to practice typing in Japanese.  
Sick of having to type Japanese on your computer with romaji?  
Want to switch to direct kana input, but can't find a way to learn the new layout?  
Look no further,&nbsp;&nbsp;*JapaneseTypingHelper* is here to help.

-------------------------------------
## What is JapaneseTypingHelper?
JapaneseTypingHelper is a desktop app that allows you to practice typing in Japanese with the direct kana input keyboard. This is much quicker than having to type in romaji, if mastered.  

## Why JapaneseTypingHelper?
Japanese Typing Helper offers a clean and simple user interface.  

### Features
- Support for the random characters to be in Katakana
- English AND Japanese UI support
- Displays the amount of correct and incorrect answers in the typing session

### Potential Future Features
- Music
- Sound effects
- More gamemodes

## Building
JapaneseTypingHelper was originally made with Visual Studio 2022. This means it has .sln files and stuff instead of CMake. I might switch it over later, but for now that is just how it is.  
You must have the lirbaries installed in order to build this app. nlohnmann json can be installed with vcpkg and QT/QML, well it's QT.

### Libraries used
- [QT/QML](https://github.com/qt)
- [nlohnmann json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

## Future Plans
This was originally an assignment I made for class in high school because I wanted to type in Japanese with the direct input, but couldn't practice it. I don't plan on releasing any updates anytime soon, but I will tend to any issues if any arise. If I end up actually "updating" this, I'll probably just rewrite the whole thing lol.
